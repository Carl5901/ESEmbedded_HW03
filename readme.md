HW03
===
This is the hw03 sample. Please follow the steps below.

# Build the Sample Program

1. Fork this repo to your own github account.

2. Clone the repo that you just forked.

3. Under the hw03 dir, use:

	* `make` to build.

	* `make clean` to clean the ouput files.

4. Extract `gnu-mcu-eclipse-qemu.zip` into hw03 dir. Under the path of hw03, start emulation with `make qemu`.

	See [Lecture 02 ─ Emulation with QEMU] for more details.

5. The sample is a minimal program for ARM Cortex-M4 devices, which enters `while(1);` after reset. Use gdb to get more details.

	See [ESEmbedded_HW02_Example] for knowing how to do the observation and how to use markdown for taking notes.

# Build Your Own Program

1. Edit main.c.

2. Make and run like the steps above.

3. Please avoid using hardware dependent C Standard library functions like `printf`, `malloc`, etc.

# HW03 Requirements

1. How do C functions pass and return parameters? Please describe the related standard used by the Application Binary Interface (ABI) for the ARM architecture.

2. Modify main.c to observe what you found.

3. You have to state how you designed the observation (code), and how you performed it.

	Just like how you did in HW02.

3. If there are any official data that define the rules, you can also use them as references.

4. Push your repo to your github. (Use .gitignore to exclude the output files like object files or executable files and the qemu bin folder)

此次作業須先製作一簡單程式碼，於是我製作了一個程式它會呼叫一個函式，之後這個函式還會在乎教令一個函式，等它運行完之後便把控制權交給上一個，由assembly code可以看出呼叫函式的作法是利用bl 更改pc數值，使其跳到所呼叫函是的起點，同時將stack下推一層，運行完畢之後便利用pop回到上一個執行的函式，直到回到最原始函式。
